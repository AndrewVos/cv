### About

I am a passionate software developer with over a decade of experience.
I enjoy learning new technologies and delivering simple, well tested software, as fast as possible.

I am great at working remotely, but will also accept on-site roles in London.

### Recent Projects

[**filmtriggers.com**](https://filmtriggers.com) the community-curated film trigger list

[**anmo.io**](https://anmo.io/) is a tool to quickly create websites with markdown.

[**ancientcitadel.com**](http://ancientcitadel.com) is a gif aggregator. It has it's own API
that converts animated gifs to webm and mp4 formats. Supporting both formats means the videos
work on all common browsers. Also the size of the gifs is drastically reduced.

[**garrison**](https://github.com/AndrewVos/garrison) is a tool used to deploy software to large
amounts of docker containers running on Amazon EC2.
