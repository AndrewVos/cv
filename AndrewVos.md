### About

I am a passionate software developer with over a decade of experience.
Ruby is my preferred language, but I enjoy golang, javascript, and some others.

For work I enjoy delivering simple well tested software on time and under budget.

NOTE: I have recently moved to Cornwall, so I am only taking on remote work.

Interests:

  - Cycling
  - Dogs
  - Writing code on prototyping boards... Wemos, Arduino etc.
  - Playing with my .vimrc and writing scripts for Arch Linux

### Recent Projects

[**myfil.ms**](https://myfil.ms) basically goodreads but for films, and much simpler. Good film recommendations too.

[**anmo.io**](https://anmo.io/) is a tool to quickly create websites with markdown. I use it for [andrewvos.com](andrewvos.com).

[**ancientcitadel.com**](http://ancientcitadel.com) is a gif aggregator. It has it's own API
that converts animated gifs to webm and mp4 formats. Supporting both formats means the videos
work on all common browsers. Also the size of the gifs is drastically reduced.

[**garrison**](https://github.com/AndrewVos/garrison) is a tool used to deploy software to large
amounts of docker containers running on Amazon EC2.
